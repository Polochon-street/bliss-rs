# Changelog

## bliss 0.10.1
* Add a way to retrieve failed analyses for a Library.
* Update dependencies.

## bliss 0.10.0
* Add support for the [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia)
  decoder (Thanks @AnthonyMichaelTDM!).
* Breaking: rename `FFmpeg` to `FFmpegDecoder`.

## bliss 0.9.4
* bump rust-ffmpeg

## bliss 0.9.3
* Library: make the config file selection "smarter".
* Library: replace XDG_DATA_HOME with XDG_CONFIG_HOME by default.

## bliss 0.9.2
* Add an extra "integration-tests" feature.

## bliss 0.9.1
* Expose the Mahalanobis distance in the library feature, reading the
  learned matrix in metric learning.
* Add training triplets to the database, used in conjunction with
  https://github.com/Polochon-street/bliss-metric-learning to do metric learning.
* Add Mahalanobis distance.

## bliss 0.9.0
* Make album playlists take into account disk numbers (no more mixed disks!).
* Add a `disc_number` field in `Song`s.
* Add a mechanism to do migrations for Libraries, to make sure we're ready
  for potential new features.
* Make `track_number` an integer, and not a string.
* Bump rust-ffmpeg*, to fix compilation warnings.

## bliss 0.8.0
* Remove the `number_songs` option from `Library::playlist_from_custom`.
  Since it now returns an Iterator, `number_songs` can just be replaced by `take`.
* `Library::playlist_from_custom` now returns an Iterator instead of a Vec.
* `Library::playlist_from_custom` now also returns the song(s) the playlist
  was built from.

## bliss 0.7.1
* Bump rust-ffmpeg to 7.0.2, to allow building on FreeBSD systems.

## bliss 0.7.0
* Make ffmpeg an optional dependency, to decouple bliss from ffmpeg:
  - Remove Song::from_path
  - Add a specific `song` and `decoder` module
  - Add a `Decoder` trait to make implementing decoders other than ffmpeg more easily
  - Add an `FFmpeg` struct implementing the previous decoding behavior with ffmpeg
  Existing code will need to be updated by replacing `Song::from_path` by
  `song::decoder::bliss_ffmpeg::FFmpeg::song_from_path`, and the other
  corresponding functions (see the updated examples for more details).
* Put the decoding logic in its own module.
* Bump ffmpeg-next version to 7.0.
* Bump aubio-rs custom crate to disable compiling it with -std=c99.
* Add the possibility to make playlists based on multiple songs using extended
  isolation forest (Thanks @SimonTeixidor!).
* Remove *_by_key family of functions (Thanks @SimonTeixidor!).
* Remove circular dependency between playlist and song by removing distances
  from the `Song` struct (Thanks @SimonTeixidor!).
